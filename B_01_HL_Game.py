**** Instructions ****

To begin, decide on a score goal (eg: The first one to get a score of 50 wins)

For each round of the game, you win points by rolling the dice.
The winner of the round is the one who gets 13 (or slightly less).

If you win the round, then your score will increase by the number of points that you earned. If you first roll of two
dice is double (eg: both dice show three), then your score will be DOUBLE the number of points.

If you lose the round, then you don't get any points.

If you tie (eg: you both get a score of 11, then you will have 11 adding to your score).

Your goal is to try to get to the target score before the computer.

Good luck.
